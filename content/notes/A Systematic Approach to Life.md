title: A Systematic Approach to Life
type: literature
---

Instead of focusing on ad-hoc goals, we should invest our time into creating habits. Why? Because habits are systematic and have a lot of benefits over goals [[The Benefits of Habits Over Goals | ]]. If we instead focus on creating long-term habits, improving becomes a way of, instead of something we only do when pursuing a goal.
