# Hi, I'm Zakk!

I'm a Solidity/Web3 developer and co-founder of [CabinDAO](https://www.creatorcabins.com/)

I like cooking, hiking, and reading. I also quite like writing about a couple of different topics, including: [technology](/technology), [building the future](/building-the-future), [high-performance knowledge work](/high-performance-knowledge-work), [building a great and sustaining business](/great-business), and [managing teams](/management).

This is my personal website, where you can learn about me, my work, and [my writing](/articles). Perhaps the best way to get started is to explore [my articles](/articles), review the site's [changelog](/changelog), or look through some of the things I'm [thinking about](/domains). A couple of articles that were popular with other people are:

- [Write Like Farnam Street](/write-like-farnam-street)
- [Don't Learn Another Framework. Do This Instead.](/dont-learn-another-framework-do-this-instead)
- [A Developer's Guide to Time Blocking](/a-developers-guide-to-time-blocking)
- [Getting to Philosophy with Roam Research](/getting-to-philosophy-with-roam-research)
- [Wise Management](/wise-management)

The best way to reach me is on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xZakk)
