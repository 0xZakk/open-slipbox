# Areas of Interest

Over the past few years, as I've read books and written articles, I've
periodically taken the time to reflect on where I've dedicated my attention. The
goal is to find a feedback loop that tells me what I'm actually interested
versus what I think I'm interested in. New tools for knowledge management have
made this easier to do. I wrote about this in [Getting to Philosophy with Roam
Research](/getting-to-philosophy-with-roam-research):

> That is the promise of Roam: that I could discover and validate the main

I expect these conerns will change over time. The current list is presented
below, in no particular order.
