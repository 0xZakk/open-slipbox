**The Refined Mind** is a bi-weekly review of ideas and notes as they are added to this site.

Every two weeks I send out a <a href="/changelog">changelog</a> with links to new and updated notes.

Most notes touch on <a href="/Writing-themes">these themes</a> in addition to <a href="/what-has-my-attention-now">what I'm thinking about now</a>.

Basically this newsletter is a biweekly look into my mind as thoughts and projects evolve. <a href="https://refinedmind.substack.com/p/01-welcome-to-the-refined-mind" target="_blank">Check out issue #1!</a>

This is an experiment so I can’t promise anything other than to care deeply about my work while doing my best to make it informative, enjoyable, and thought-provoking.
